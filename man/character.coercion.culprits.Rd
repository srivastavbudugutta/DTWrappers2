\title{Identify Character Values Preventing Numeric Conversion}
\usage{
character.coercion.culprits(x, threshold.for.numeric = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of values that should be a numeric vector but was coerced to a character due to a small number of non-numeric entries.}

\item{threshold.for.numeric}{A value between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum proportion of x that does not "look" numeric. If 'threshold.for.numeric = 0.1', then no more than 10% of the values in x can be values that do not "look" numeric.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used).}
}
\value{
A character vector of values that are preventing 'x' from being converted to numeric. Returns 'NA` if the proportion of non-numeric values exceeds the threshold.
}
\description{
This function identifies which character values in a vector are preventing it from being converted to a numeric vector.
